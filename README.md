# Python-Practicals
These are sets of Python 3 practicals which are given by our college as assignments.


# Practical -3: List, Dictionary, and Set
1) A group of statisticians at a local college has asked you to create a set of functions
that compute the median and mode of a set of numbers. Define these functions
in a module named stats.py. Also include a function named mean, which computes
the average of a set of numbers. Each function should expect a list of numbers as
an argument and return a single number. Each function should return 0 if the list
is empty. Include a main function that tests the three statistical functions with a
given list.

2) Write a program that allows the user to navigate the lines of text in a file. The
program should prompt the user for a filename and input the lines of text into a
list. The program then enters a loop in which it prints the number of lines in the
file and prompts the user for a line number. Actual line numbers range from 1 to
the number of lines in the file. If the input is 0, the program quits. Otherwise, the
program prints the line associated with that number.

3) Write a program to convert each decimal number given in list to a fixed size binary
and generate a dictionary containing binary value as key and decimal number as
value.

4) Define a function decimalToRep that returns the representation of an integer in a
given base. The two arguments should be the integer and the base. The function
should return a string. It should use a lookup table that associates integers with
digits. Include a main function that tests the conversion function with numbers in
several bases.

5) Write a program that inputs a text file. The program should print all of the unique
words in the file in alphabetical order.

6) A file concordance tracks the unique words in a file and their frequencies. Write a
program that displays a concordance for a file. The program should output the
unique words and their frequencies in alphabetical order.

7) Write a Python program to convert list to list of dictionaries.
Sample lists: ["Black", "Red", "Maroon", "Yellow"], ["#000000", "#FF0000",
"#800000", "#FFFF00"]
Expected Output: [{'color_name': 'Black', 'color_code': '#000000'}, {'color_name':
'Red', 'color_code': '#FF0000'}, {'color_name': 'Maroon', 'color_code': '#800000'},
{'color_name': 'Yellow', 'color_code': '#FFFF00'}]

8) Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list of lists.
Sample list : [[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]
New List : [[10, 20], [30, 56, 25], [33], [40]]
